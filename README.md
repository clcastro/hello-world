First Repo in GitHub

Hi, GitHubbers!

I am CL Castro and this is my first time using GitHub. I'll need to use this for my Masters Thesis. I'm working on Blockchain and its use for the Education Sector (e.g., securing educational records, Blockcerts). To anyone who reads this and has a good grasp of Blockchain and developing apps around it, please contact me! Have a good day y'all! :)
